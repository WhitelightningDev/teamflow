Place your brand logo files here. Suggested filenames:

- teamflow-logo.png        (full logo used in navbars, emails, favicon)
- teamflow-mark.png        (optional logo mark only)

Frontend uses the following env vars to override defaults:
- VITE_BRAND_NAME
- VITE_BRAND_LOGO_URL
- VITE_BRAND_LOGO_MARK_URL
- VITE_BRAND_EMAIL_LOGO_URL

If env vars are not provided, the app falls back to /brand/teamflow-logo.png.
